# Perceptron

## Dimension of vectors

Number of weights must be equal to the number of features
(inputs, attributes, measurements, dimensions)

bias is a scalar, a single random (either 0 or random generated)

Now, number of rows (samples) of a feature must be equal
to number of labels/examples in the target variable

## Features and Labels

Remember that we are operating on values, convert dataframe to Numpy array


## Numpy matmul vs np.dot()

There is runtime warning for matmul, overflow for int
